## Backend Server — PHASES 1–4 COMPLETE

### What Is Built (`liminal-sin-gemini` repo)

| File | Status | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `server/server.ts` | ✅ Done | Express + WebSocket server on PORT 3001 (local) / 8080 (Cloud Run) |
| `server/types/state.ts` | ✅ Done | TrustLevel enum, PlayerEmotion, PlayerSession, GmEvent types |
| `server/services/db.ts` | ✅ Done | Firestore ADC adapter with in-memory fallback |
| `server/services/gemini.ts` | ✅ Done | Vertex AI client + GM system prompts + 4 tool declarations |
| `server/services/gameMaster.ts` | ✅ Done | GM function call router — persists state + broadcasts GmEvent over WS |
| `server/tsconfig.build.json` | ✅ Done | Emits compiled JS to `dist/server/server.js` |
| `Dockerfile` | ✅ Done | 2-stage build (node:20-alpine), Cloud Run ready |
| `.gcloudignore` | ✅ Done | Strips docs/assets/public from Cloud Build upload |

### What the Server Currently Does (Reality Check)
- Accepts WebSocket connections
- Routes `GM_FUNCTION_CALL` messages to `gameMaster.ts`
- Echoes all other messages back (stub — not real gameplay)
- **Gemini is NEVER called. No audio streams. No NPC speaks. GM does not perceive anything.**

### What Does NOT Exist Yet
- [ ] **Gemini Live session wiring** — BLOCKING EVERYTHING. No voice, no agents without this.
- [ ] Webcam frame pipe (GM vision: 1 JPEG/sec → Gemini)
- [ ] NPC character agent system prompts injected at session start
- [ ] VAD / barge-in handler (player interrupts mid-NPC-sentence)
- [ ] FMV scene switching (frontend reads SCENE_CHANGE event, swaps video)
- [x] Frontend game wrapper (`/ls/game`) — DONE in myceliainteractive repo
- [ ] Cloud Run deployment (Dockerfile ready, just needs `gcloud run deploy`)

## Architecture Decision (March 6, 2026)

**`liminal-sin-gemini` is a pure backend repo. Zero frontend code lives here.**
- All UI, game wrappers, and marketing live in `myceliainteractive` (Cloudflare Pages)
- `app/`, `components/`, Next.js, React, Tailwind, framer-motion, etc. are ALL deleted
- 315 frontend npm packages removed
- Remaining deps: `express`, `ws`, `firebase-admin`, `@google/genai`, `dotenv`

## Next Priority Action

**IMMEDIATE — Wire Gemini Live audio in `server/server.ts`**
This is the single most critical unbuilt piece. The entire game depends on it.

1. Open a Gemini Live session (`ai.live.connect()`) when a WS client connects
2. Forward incoming binary audio from the browser to Gemini
3. Stream Gemini's audio response back to the browser
4. Intercept Gemini function calls → route to `gameMaster.ts`
5. Handle VAD / barge-in (player speaks → truncate Gemini output)

**After Gemini Live is wired:**
- Inject NPC system prompts (Jason first) at session start
- Build `/ls/game` frontend in `myceliainteractive`
- Run `gcloud run deploy` (Dockerfile already ready)

## March 5, 2026 — Session Summary

### Marketing Shell (myceliainteractive repo) — IN PROGRESS
- Landing page `myceliainteractive.com/ls` live with all sections: navbar, hero, lore, Trust System cards, What Awaits You, signup forms, footer
- Judge backdoor `myceliainteractive.com/ls/judges` live
- D1 database `liminal-sin-signups` provisioned with `signups` table (name, email, type, created_at, email1_sent, email2_sent) + `settings` table (game_live flag)
- Cloudflare Worker (`workers/signup-api.ts`) handling `POST /api/signup`, `POST /api/set-game-live` (Bearer token protected), and cron every minute for Email 2
- **Email system**: Brevo transactional API (free tier, 300/day). Email 1 fires instantly on signup. Email 2 fires when admin calls `/api/set-game-live`
- `BREVO_API_KEY` and `ADMIN_TOKEN` stored as encrypted Cloudflare secrets
- `npm run deploy` script chains `next build && wrangler deploy` — prevents stale asset deploys
- `.gitignore` updated with `*.tsbuildinfo`
- `AGENTS.md` + `copilot-instructions.md` updated: always `npm run build` before deploy rule added

### Known Pending (marketing shell)
- [X] Test and confirm Email 1 delivers to `[redacted]@email.com` via Brevo (pending as of session end)

## Next Priority Action

**Priority 1 — Cloud Foundation (BLOCKING everything)**
> Nothing can be tested without a live Firestore + Gemini Live API connection.

1. Create / select GCP project ID `myceliainteractive`
2. Enable APIs: Vertex AI, Cloud Run, Firestore, Cloud Build, Secret Manager, Cloud Storage
3. Create Firestore database in Native mode (`us-west1`)
4. Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` to `.env.local` (get from Google AI Studio / Google Cloud Console)
5. Add Firebase config values to `.env.local` (Firebase Console → Project Settings → Web App)
6. Run `npm run dev` and confirm local dev server starts with no errors

**Priority 2 — GameMaster Gateway (Cloud Run service)**
> See `README.md` Section ☁️ Cloud System Setup → Step D

**Priority 3 — Jason Character Agent (first playable moment)**
> Wire one character (Jason) to Gemini Live API with voice input + trust/fear state write to Firestore

## Known IP Notes
- "Bally's" references in docs refer to Bally's Las Vegas (rebranded to Horseshoe Las Vegas, Dec 2022)
- Fictional framing is covered by disclaimer in `README.md` — see Attribution & Legal section
- "The Boring Company" is similarly covered by same disclaimer
- No action required on either name — fiction/parody framing + explicit disclaimer = adequate protection
