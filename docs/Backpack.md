## OVERVIEW

Jason's backpack is the **only inventory system in the game**. There are no menus, no item wheels, no UI overlays. Items exist narratively — the player must verbally ask Jason to use, check, or distribute gear. Jason will describe what he finds, what condition it's in, and what it does. The backpack is also a **trust-building mechanism**: asking Jason to share gear with Audrey or Josh is one of the primary ways to increase character trust.

The backpack contents are physically visible in the **cracked smart-glasses HUD overlay** — items appear as flickering inventory icons in the lower-right corner of the screen, glitching in and out based on HUD damage state.

---

## THE SMART GLASSES — PRIMARY POV DEVICE

**Status:** Cracked. Partially functional. HUD flickering.  
**Narrative function:** The player's eyes. The game's entire visual perspective runs through these.

### Physical Description
- Prototype hardware — not a consumer product. Chunky frame, matte black, with a thin heads-up display strip across the right lens.
- The right lens took the impact of the fall. There is a spiderweb crack across the lower-right quadrant. This crack is a **permanent visual element** — a vignette that never fully goes away.
- The left lens is intact but occasionally flickers, producing brief total-blackout frames.

### Filter Modes (Visual Prompt Modifiers)
Switching filters changes what the Game Master agent "sees" and triggers new environmental events and dialogue.

| Filter | Command | What It Reveals | Narrative Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Standard** | *"Switch to normal"* | Default 4K visual feed, cracked overlay | Baseline reality |
| **Infrared (IR)** | *"Switch to infrared"* | Heat signatures, thermal anomalies in dark water | Detect living things — or things that produce heat and shouldn't |
| **Night Vision** | *"Switch to night vision"* | Illuminates pitch-black tunnels and submerged slides | Navigate without a flashlight; reveals what's in the water |
| **Full Spectrum** | *"Switch to full spectrum"* | Hidden Slotsky signals, invisible environmental writing, anomalies the naked eye misses | The deepest truth layer — use sparingly; triggers Slotsky awareness |

### HUD Elements (Glitching)
- **Battery indicator** — Smart glasses run on an internal cell. Drain is narrative, not a death mechanic. When low, the screen flickers more aggressively.
- **Inventory ghost icons** — Flickering silhouettes of backpack items in lower-right corner.
- **Proximity indicator** — A faint signal bar that pulses when Audrey or Josh are within RANGE or ECHO distance. Corrupts at ISOLATED range.
- **Timestamp** — Normally shows current time. Begins malfunctioning in deeper layers. By Layer 4, the timestamp reads **47 years in the future**.

## BACKPACK CONTENTS — FULL MANIFEST

### 1. FLASHLIGHT (PRIMARY)
**Quantity:** 1  
**Condition:** Functional. Took some impact but survived the fall.  
**Description:** A heavy-duty handheld flashlight — the kind you'd find at a hardware store, not a specialty shop. Rubberized grip, slightly dented casing. Still throws a strong beam.  
**Mechanic:** Jason holds it in his off-hand. When active, it casts a cone of visible light in the smart-glasses feed, reducing shadow coverage. Slotsky can flicker it.  
**Narrative note:** The first thing Jason reaches for when he lands. Its beam sweeping across the water-park slides is the first clear image the player gets of the chamber.

---

### 2. SPARE BATTERIES (AA AND CR123A)
**Quantity:** 2 AA battery packs (4 each), 1 pack of CR123A (3 count)  
**Condition:** Sealed. Dry. Still good.  
**Description:** Standard ghost-hunt prep. AA cells are for the flashlight and action cameras. CR123A cells power the smart glasses' HUD backup circuit.  
**Mechanic:** Jason can use batteries to **extend HUD uptime** when the glasses are failing, or to **restore a distributed item** (like an action camera given to Audrey or Josh) to working condition.  
**Narrative note:** Audrey specifically asks for the CR123As if her flashlight fails. Knowing this is a micro-trust moment — it means she knows the gear spec. She's been here before.

---

### 3. ACTION CAMERAS (UNBRANDED) x2
**Quantity:** 2  
**Condition:** One intact. One cracked screen but functional recording.  
**Description:** Small rectangular body-cam-style cameras, roughly GoPro-sized. No branding — they're third-party clones. Shoulder-mount clips, chest-mount clips, and helmet-mount clips are in a side pocket. No live feed — they record to internal storage only.  
**Mechanic:** Jason can **mount one on himself** (adds a secondary angle to FMV clips — used for close reaction shots) or **give one to Audrey or Josh** (unlocks their POV FMV clip set and increases proximity awareness for the Game Master).  
**Narrative note:** If the player sends a camera to Josh, it becomes a dark joke — Josh immediately tries to use it to document his own "survival reality show." The mask in action.

---

### 4. MULTIMETER
**Quantity:** 1  
**Condition:** Functional.  
**Description:** A standard digital multimeter — the tool you use to measure voltage, resistance, and continuity in electrical circuits. Compact, yellow-and-black casing, leads still attached and coiled.  
**Mechanic:** Used to interact with the chamber's **flood construction lighting grid**. Jason can probe junction boxes to check power flow, identify which lights can be sustained, and potentially reroute power to darker sections of the chamber.  
**Narrative note:** The multimeter also reacts to **Slotsky's presence** — its display fluctuates and shows impossible readings (negative resistance, infinite voltage) near playing card arrangements or in corridors that have been rearranged. It is an involuntary Slotsky detector.

---

### 5. VOICEBOX DEVICE
**Quantity:** 1  
**Condition:** Functioning, but intermittent. Speaker grille is slightly cracked.  
**Description:** A small handheld speaker/receiver designed to amplify and transmit voice over short distances — used in ghost hunts to potentially capture EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) and to broadcast audio into a space. About the size of a walkie-talkie. Has a small LCD that shows audio waveform.  
**Mechanic:** The voicebox is the **physical explanation** for how the player's disembodied voice reaches Jason. Narratively, the characters believe the player is communicating through it — even though the device's speaker activates on its own and no one pressed transmit.  
**Special behavior:** When Slotsky is active nearby, the voicebox picks up **slot machine audio artifacts** — the ghost of a jackpot sound, reversed number readouts, static bursts in 3-pull rhythm. The waveform LCD shows activity even in dead silence.  
**Narrative note:** Josh's first instinct when the voicebox activates on its own is to call it "a loose connection." By the third time, he stops saying anything.

---

### 6. NOTEBOOK — "CLUE ARCHITECTURE"
**Quantity:** 1  
**Condition:** Slightly water-damaged on the lower corner from the landing. Pages intact and readable.  
**Description:** A standard black hardcover field notebook (Moleskine-style). Contains Audrey's pre-hunt notes — floor maps she sketched from memory, rumors she collected from coworkers about the lower levels, and a list of six reported "incidents" in the Bally's basement over the past decade. She handed it to Jason before they went in.  
**Mechanic:** The notebook is the **lore delivery system**. When Jason reads from it (on player request), the Game Master uses the contents to inject contextual detail into character dialogue and unlock hidden story branches. Some entries reference Slotsky behavior before the group had a name for it.  
**Key entries (partial — more revealed as trust builds):**
- *"Maintenance crew reported hearing slot sounds in the sub-basement — no machines down there. Two guys quit same week."*
- *"Audrey's note, underlined twice: 'The couple in formal wear. Not the first time. Maria saw them in 2019. They went down. Nobody went after them.'"*
- *"Sketch of lower escalator landing. 'This is where the floor feels wrong' written in margin."*
- *[Page 7 — water-damaged, unreadable. Jason can describe the ink bleed but cannot recover the text.]*

---

### 7. SECONDARY FLASHLIGHT (MINI)
**Quantity:** 1  
**Condition:** Functional. Small.  
**Description:** A pocket-sized flashlight — backup unit, clip-style. Much lower lumen output than the primary. Fits in a palm.  
**Mechanic:** Designed to be **distributed**. Jason can give this to Audrey or Josh as a trust gesture. Having their own light source changes their proximity behavior — characters with light are more willing to explore independently, which advances the FOUND state faster but increases their exposure to Slotsky events.  
**Narrative note:** The moment Audrey receives the mini flashlight and clicks it on is the first time the player hears her voice shift from muffled-and-scared to something approaching focused.

---

### 8. GHOST-HUNTING EQUIPMENT POUCH (MISC)
**Quantity:** 1 zippered pouch  
**Condition:** Intact.  
**Contents:**
- **EMF Reader (basic):** Detects electromagnetic field fluctuations. Slotsky's corridor rearrangements produce massive EMF spikes. The reader goes into alarm mode near playing card arrangements.
- **Laser temperature gun:** Measures surface temperature. The water in the submerged water-park section reads 3°C — colder than it has any reason to be.
- **USB stick (labeled "BACKUP" in Sharpie):** Unknown contents. Cannot be accessed without a device. Audrey recognizes it — it's hers. She will ask for it specifically if trust is high enough. What's on it is Act 2 content.
- **Spare memory card:** For the action cameras. Blank. Standard.

## DISTRIBUTION LOGIC — GEAR AS TRUST MECHANIC

The backpack is not just inventory — it is a **relationship system**. Giving gear to a character increases their `trust_level` and shifts their `proximity_state` toward RANGE/FOUND. Withholding gear when a character asks lowers trust.

| Item Given To | Trust Effect | Gameplay Unlock |
|---|---|---|
| Mini flashlight → Audrey | +trust, Audrey moves toward RANGE | Unlocks Audrey's lore dialogue about the notebook entries |
| Action camera → Josh | +trust (and he makes a joke about it) | Unlocks Josh POV FMV clips, advances FOUND state |
| CR123A batteries → Audrey | Significant +trust (she knows the spec) | Audrey reveals first piece of hidden underground knowledge |
| USB stick → Audrey | Major +trust (she recognizes it) | Locked to Act 2 — storing this for later is the correct play |
| Voicebox → either character | Creates confusion + unease | They now hear the player's voice from the device directly — existential discomfort. Slight trust drop, then climb. |

---

## PHYSICAL CONDITION OVER TIME

The backpack is not a static inventory. As the game progresses through deeper layers (Act 2+), items degrade:

- Batteries drain. Electronics behave strangely near Slotsky activity.
- The notebook's water damage spreads — pages become unreadable if the group enters flooded sections.
- The multimeter begins producing Slotsky readings even when not near an anomaly — the deeper the descent, the more the house's probability logic bleeds into the hardware.
- The smart glasses' HUD corruption worsens at each layer transition.
- By Layer 4 (The Machine), the only item still functioning reliably is the voicebox. It is the last thing working. It is still picking up signals.
