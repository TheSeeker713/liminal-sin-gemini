> *"The transition from the hyper-vibrant neon of the Las Vegas Strip to the dim, shuttered basement mall of Bally's serves as a visual metaphor for erasure. The decay of the visual signal mirrors the characters' descent from the world of the living into a world of noclipped reality."*

## OVERVIEW

Bally's (now officially **Horseshoe Las Vegas**) is the physical anchor of LIMINAL SIN. The game begins here, in the real world, before reality fails. Every location used in the intro FMV is a **real, documentable place** — this is intentional. The horror works because the grounding is authentic before it breaks.

For AI prompt context: all image and video generation referencing the above-ground locations must match the real physical Bally's/Horseshoe exterior and interior aesthetic. Do not invent architecture. Ground it first.

## CANONICAL LOCATIONS (INTRO FMV USE ONLY)

### 1. EXTERIOR — Bally's/Horseshoe Facade
**Real-world description:** The iconic Bally's/Horseshoe Las Vegas sign on the Strip. Illuminated neon signage visible from significant distance. Late-night atmosphere — minimal foot traffic, ambient street glow, the contrast between the lit facade and the dark sky above.

**Shot use:** Drone establishing shot. The camera begins wide on the Strip neon-bleed and pushes slowly toward the Bally's sign. Sets the late-night, real-world tone before anything supernatural occurs.

**AI prompt language:**
- *"Aerial drone shot, Las Vegas Strip at night, neon light bleed on wet pavement, slow push-in toward Bally's/Horseshoe Las Vegas illuminated sign, overcast dark sky, empty street, cinematic lo-fi grain"*
- Reference: Bally's exterior illuminated signage, colorful escalators visible in exterior shots.

**Cracked-glasses overlay:** NOT applied here. Pre-fall footage is clean. The vignette activates only after the noclip event.

---

### 2. INTERIOR — Bally's Avenue Shops (Basement Mall / "Layer 0")
**Real-world description:** The Avenue Shops at Bally's is a basement-level retail concourse — historically described as a "ghost town" of shuttered storefronts, echoing arcades, and flickering fluorescent corridors. It represents the dying era of the casino mall. Many shops are closed. The few still-open kiosks (including Audrey's) operate in near-silence.

**Narrative mood:** Nostalgic dread. The uncanny silence of a commercial space designed for crowds that no longer come. The fluorescent hum. The echoing footsteps. The sense that time stopped here sometime in the mid-2000s and the building hasn't noticed yet.

**Shot use:** Interior establishing shots. Audrey's kiosk still lit. Closed gates. Dead arcade machines. Flickering overhead tubes.

**Key visual details for AI prompts:**
- Half-shuttered metal security gates on storefronts
- Dated commercial interior design — the architecture of 1990s retail excess
- Fluorescent tube lighting, some flickering, some dead
- Reflective floor tile that picks up the glow of the remaining lights
- Complete absence of other people except the three characters

**AI prompt language:**
- *"Interior of abandoned Las Vegas casino mall, basement level, half-shuttered storefronts, flickering fluorescent overhead lighting, reflective tile floor, empty corridors, late night, no people, nostalgic decay, analog horror aesthetic, lo-fi grain"*

**Cracked-glasses overlay:** NOT applied. Still pre-fall.

### 3. THE ESCALATORS — Noclip Point
**Real-world description:** Bally's features a distinctive set of **illuminated, colorful escalators** connecting its floor levels — a well-documented visual landmark of the property. The escalator landing between levels is the canonical noclip trigger point.

**The event:**
1. The formally-dressed couple is observed walking through the **sealed escalator gate** — a physical barrier that should stop them. It doesn't. They pass through it like it isn't there and descend.
2. Jason, Josh, and Audrey chase them. The gate swings open as they approach.
3. They step onto the escalator landing.
4. The floor of the landing gives way — not a collapse, not a break. It simply stops being solid. Physics fails.
5. They fall.

**Shot use:** The key horror beat of the intro FMV. Tone shifts here from "eerie but real" to "this is not right." This is the last moment in the real world.

**AI prompt language:**
- *"Interior escalator of Bally's Las Vegas, colorful illuminated handrails, late night, empty, a formally dressed couple passing through a closed gate that should block them, motion blur on the couple, three people in background watching in shock, lo-fi analog horror grain"*

**Cracked-glasses overlay:** BEGINS applying here — immediately after the gate passes. The crack appears mid-fall. From this point forward, all Jason POV footage has the spiderweb fracture in the lower-right quadrant.

### 4. WHAT IS NOT IN THE PROTOTYPE (LAYER 0 LIMIT)

The intro FMV covers the exterior, the basement mall, and the escalator noclip point. That is the full extent of Bally's as a filming/generation location.

**After the fall, the game is no longer at Bally's.**

The chamber Jason lands in — the Boring Tunnel / Water Park merge — is a distinct layer beneath the real building. It shares no visual language with the Bally's interior. The transition is deliberate and total.

---

## THE CONNECTION: JUBILEE TOWER → JUBILEE MINE

A critical narrative anchor for the AI agents' context:

- **Bally's Jubilee Tower** is a real physical landmark of the property — one of the hotel towers.
- **The Jubilee Mine** in Eldorado Canyon (Nelson's Landing, Nevada) is a real historical site — a blood-soaked Civil War-era mine where deserters and fugitives sought lawless refuge. The murder of Charles Nelson by Ahvote occurred here.
- The agents are instructed to treat these as **connected** — the tower above, the mine below, the same vein of cursed Nevada earth running between them.
- This connection is never stated explicitly in gameplay. It surfaces through Audrey's lore unlocks and the multimeter's impossible readings deep in Layer 4.

## VISUAL PRODUCTION NOTES

### For Drone Shot (Shot 1)
- Capture at night only. Day footage is unusable for tone.
- Albuquerque stand-in locations acceptable for preliminary storyboard (drone establishing shot of a neon-lit commercial strip can substitute during Phase 1 offline work).
- Final footage: actual Las Vegas Strip aerial or AI-generated via Veo 3.1 Standard using the prompt language above.

### For Interior Shots (Shots 2–3)
- The Avenue Shops aesthetic can be partially matched using any dead/dying mall interior for storyboard reference.
- Final AI generation: Morphic-seeded characters placed into Grok Imagine-generated Bally's interior stills, then animated via Veo 3.1.
- Color temperature: cool fluorescent white. Not warm. The warmth is gone from this place.

### Cracked-Glasses Overlay Protocol
- The crack vignette is a **post-processing overlay** applied to all Jason POV footage from the moment of noclip onward.
- It is NOT a filter in the smart-glasses UI — it is the physical state of the hardware after impact.
- The Smart Glasses filter modes (IR, NV, Full Spectrum) operate underneath the crack overlay. The crack is always visible regardless of which filter is active.
- In Layer 4 (The Machine), the crack has spread — the vignette covers more of the frame.

## HISTORICAL LORE CONTEXT (AI AGENT INJECTION)

The following real-world historical details are injected into the Game Master and character agent context windows as background lore. Characters reference these organically — never as exposition dumps.

| Historical Element | Narrative Use |
|---|---|
| **Nelson's Landing / Eldorado Canyon** | Anomalous sounds attributed to ghosts of murdered prospectors from the 1860s |
| **Jubilee Mine** | The origin point of Slotsky's logic — the place where the underground's probability rules were first established |
| **Murder of Charles Nelson by Ahvote** | Referenced by Audrey at high trust as a "story she heard from a maintenance worker" |
| **Civil War deserters seeking refuge** | The underground's "previous tenants" — the flood drain plywood shelters echo this history |
| **Vigilante justice in Eldorado Canyon** | Slotsky's three-bells rhythm mirrors the three-count of vigilante reckoning |
