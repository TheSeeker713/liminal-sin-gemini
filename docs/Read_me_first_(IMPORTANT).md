read all attached docs first. With special focus on the Character doc...

I'm waiting on GOOGLE CLOUD to give me approval for the $100 in credits to build on the cloud for the contest. It could be a few days from today... What can we do right now to get this project rolling?
 
note: we need to do very specific things.
 

1. we need to log everything we do in multiple things.

2. A. Screenshots

3. B. Dev log Blogging

4. C. Screenrecording

 
This documenting progress workflow is imperative for multiple reasons:

1. gaining a following

2. encouraging self motivating success

3. contest bonuses

 
We need to build the characters. the models, the personas, and we need to do it fast.
We need to build live action storyboarding scenes. which for this prototype should only be a drone establishing shot of Las Vegas. Exterior of Bally's, interior of the Bally's shops, the escalators. and The Boring Tunnel/ merged water park.
 
There should be nothing else for this prototype.
 
I imagine when the player starts the game. We do not have a "menu" like a traditional game. There is a FMV video that first plays, it should be 1-2minutes long. It introduces the location, the characters, the ghost hunting theme. then it brings everything into the game by showing the "noclipping" event. Jason and friends fall deep below Bally's into the Vegas Underground.
 
He is immediately separate from his friends. He lands on the ground, not the water.. we begin in the "Tunnel". unfinished but it has lights.. flood construction lights, etc. His smart Glasses equipment is broken. The FMV video clip ends. the game begins. A small flashing hint on the screen as a static looping FMV sequence occurs. The hint is : "Talk to Jason with your voice" then fades... then another hint at corner of the screen. "Make sure your mic and web cam are on for full immersion" then fades.
the FMV sequence is a static loop. Jason looking at his surroundings. The audio is Ai generated at this point in Jason's and his friends voice. He yells for them. they yell back.. but somewhat muffled, distorted.. distant..
He talks to himself quietly: "shit... what do i do"... And ai generates other audio while listening for the Player to intervene. Jason reacts to player... after a moment of trust is built.. jason then moves on.. when Jason moves on.. another FMV sequence is played until it reaches and end, then a looping static FMV takes place waiting Player feedback... on a timed loop... while waiting for feedback... the ai in the background is generating audio, and video clips based on the scene and putting it in a temp storage behind the scenes. Depending on player feedback.. it will either play a pre generated scene from storage... or a FMV template fallback clip from studio generation (morphic, etc) or generate and new set while stalling the player with Jason asking questions...
