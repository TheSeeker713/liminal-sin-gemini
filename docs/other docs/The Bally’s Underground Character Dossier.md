**Jason (The Filmmaker / Protagonist & POV)**

* **Occupation:** Guerrilla Filmmaker / Cameraman 1, 2\.  
* **Background:** A Las Vegas local who has come to the lower, nearly abandoned shopping levels of Bally's casino late at night to film a ghost hunt 3, 4\.  
* **Persona:** He operates with a distinct **documentarian and observant mindset**. When a formally dressed couple walks straight through closed elevator doors, his first instinct is to quietly notice and observe rather than immediately speak up 3-5.  
* **Key Inventory/Mechanics:** He wears a **prototype pair of smart glasses** that serve as the player's primary point of view, capable of switching between standard, infrared, night vision, and full-spectrum filters 6, 7\. He acts as the team's pack mule, handing out gear from a backpack loaded with flashlights, extra batteries, two unbranded action cameras, a multimeter, and a voicebox 3, 4, 6, 7\.

**Audrey (The Shop Employee)**

* **Occupation:** Retail Employee in the Bally's basement mall 3, 4\.  
* **Background:** A Las Vegas local who is the catalyst for the expedition. She invited Jason and Josh to the casino after hours because she swears the location is genuinely haunted 1, 2\.  
* **Persona:** She possesses **hidden knowledge and theories** about the casino's below-floor secrets that she has never fully shared with the group 8\. Depending on how the player interacts with her, she may either help the group survive or her trust could bottom out, resulting in her separating from the others 9, 10\.

**Josh (The Best Friend)**

* **Occupation:** Unspecified (Best friend to Jason) 1, 2\.  
* **Background:** A Las Vegas local who tagged along for the late-night ghost hunt mostly for the ride 1, 11\.  
* **Persona:** He acts as the **rationalizer and skeptic** of the group 8\. Initially, he treats the ghost-hunting equipment like a bit of a joke and fumbles with it 12\. When faced with impossible horrors or fourth-wall breaks, his coping mechanism is to try and rationalize the situation, use joking deflections, or express genuine anger and fear 13, 14\. If his psyche cracks and his trust in the player drops too low, he may even attempt to negotiate with the player for his own survival over the others 15\.

**Slotsky (The Entity)**

* **Occupation:** The Probability Engine / The Logic of the Underground 16\.  
* **Background:** A completely invisible, supernatural monster that governs the liminal depths beneath Las Vegas 6, 16, 17\.  
* **Persona:** Slotsky has **no real visual representation** 6, 17\. It operates as the manifestation of the casino concept that **"the house always wins"** 16\. As an atmospheric manipulator, it actively reshapes corridors, removes exits, and creates impossible odds for the trapped friends 16\. It communicates its presence strictly through environmental anomalies—such as the sudden sound of a slot machine payout ringing through empty concrete, or playing cards found deliberately arranged in strange patterns on tunnel walls 9, 13\.
